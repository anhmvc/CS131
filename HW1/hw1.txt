For the set operations functions, I utilized my mathematical knowledge of set operations and hints from the TA-given pseudocode and discussion slides.
The hardest part of the assignment was learning the syntax of Ocaml and getting familiar with the logic behind functional programming.
My approach for the filter_reachable function:
1. Filter ruleset to return a set of rules that start with given Start nonterminal
2. Use this filtered ruleset to recursively get all reachable nonterminals by looking at the right-hand side of each rule
3. Recursively repeat Step 1 until I have processed all reachable nonterminals
4. Filter reachableRules from the original rules 

It was difficult to come up with a recursive solution for this problem, since I am more familiar with using loops to solve similar problems.
Nonetheless, the recursive solution that I implemented uses a similar logic as graph-traversal DFS algorithm when processing starting nonterminals.
